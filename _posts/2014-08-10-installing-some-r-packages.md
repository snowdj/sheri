I'm doing Coursera's [Specialization in Data Science] and right now I'm in the third course of it, called Getting and Cleaning Data.

In order to answer this week quiz, I needed to install some R packages to load files in different formats. It took me some time to do it, so I'll document my steps here for anyone that may have trouble doing it. 

## Installing xlsx package

I needed to install a package to read  <span style="font-style:italic">xlsx</span> files. I naively attempted to install it in R Studio, running under Debian Wheezy, but I got the following error:

{% highlight console %}
> install.packages("xlsx")
Installing package into ‘/home/allan/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.1’
(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)
also installing the dependencies ‘rJava’, ‘xlsxjars’

If you don't have root privileges, run
R CMD javareconf -e
to set all Java-related variables and then install rJava.

{% endhighlight %} 

As you can see, it suggested me to run a command to add Java support to R, so I did it:

{% highlight console %}
$ R CMD javareconf

{% endhighlight %}

Another error! This time, something was wrong with the Java library linking. 

First thing I tryed was to change the Java version to 7:

{% highlight console %}
$ update-alternatives --config java
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status

  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1051      manual mode

Press enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 2
{% endhighlight %}

It didn't work. So I took a drastic measure and installed everything from Java 7:

{% highlight console %}
$ apt-get install openjdk-7-*
{% endhighlight %}

And then the `R CMD javareconf` command worked! But I wasn't done.

Back to RStudio I got another error when installing package  <span style="font-style:italic">rjava</span>, needed by  <span style="font-style:italic">xlsx</span> and the reason why I had to setup Java in the first place. This time the error message was complaining about a missing  <span style="font-style:italic">lzma</span> library. Unfortunately, I can't show you the exact error messsage, as I can't find the log in my system, but anyway, here is the solution:

{% highlight console %}
$ apt-get install liblzma-dev
{% endhighlight %}

And then it worked! I could finally load my <span style="font-style:italic">xlsx</span> file and answer the quiz!

## Install XML package

After sucessfully installing  <span style="font-style:italic">xlsx</span>, I had to install the  <span style="font-style:italic">XML</span> package, but this one was a lot easier. The only dependency missing in my system was  <span style="font-style:italic">xml2-config</span>, which happend to be part of the  <span style="font-style:italic">libxml2-dev</span> package:

{% highlight console %}
$ apt-get install libxml2-dev
{% endhighlight %}

After succesfully installing  <span style="font-style:italic">XML</span>     package at RStudio, I could finally finish this week quiz.
