This is built on the Balzac Jekyll theme by Cole Townsend. I'd love to think that I one day I might be able to offer up a pull request of some modest use to help contribute.

I'm going to use this theme as my boilerplate and attempt to add in better support for image-focused content.

I want to start working in the open more so that I can learn more whilst contributing to the community in whatever little way possible.

### Acknowledgements
CT took [Michael Rose](http://twitter.com/mmistakes)'s theme [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Having a prebuilt archive and the YAML front-matter already set up was a great help. 

Many thanks to Daniel Bruce for the wonderful Entypo icons. Those can be picked up at [entypo.com](http://entypo.com), but are included with the source files. It's also <b>retina ready</b> via retina.js. Check out how that works over at [retinajs.com](http://retinajs.com).

### The Name
Balzac was a famous writer, known for his beautiful prose. I read some Balzac in school, but mostly feel comfort in the name of my favorite coffee shop in Stratford, Ontario.
