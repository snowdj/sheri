# Customization

## _config.yml

Most of the variables found here are used in the .html files found in `_includes` if you need to add or remove anything. A good place to start would be to change the title, tagline, description, and url of your site. When working locally comment out `url` or else you will get a bunch of broken links because they are absolute and prefixed with `{{ site.url }}` in the various `_includes` and `_layouts`. Just remember to uncomment `url` when building for deployment or pushing to **gh-pages**...

### Owner/Author Information

Change your name, bio, Twitter url, email, etc.


### Top Navigation Links

Edit page/post titles and URLs to include in the site's navigation. For external links add `external: true`.

``` yaml
# sample top navigation links
links:
  - title: About Page
    url: /about
  - title: Other Page
    url: /other-page
  - title: External Page
    url: http://example.com
    external: true
```

## Other Stuff

The rest is just your average Jekyll config settings. Nothing too crazy here...

### _includes

For the most part you can leave these as is since the author/owner details are pulled from `_config.yml`. That said you'll probably want to customize the copyright stuff in `footer.html` to your liking.

### Adding Posts and Pages

There are two main content layouts: `post.html` (for posts) and `page.html` (for pages). Both have large **feature images** that span the full-width of the screen, and both are meant for text heavy blog posts (or articles). 

### Feature Images

A good rule of thumb is to keep feature images nice and wide so you don't push the body text too far down. An image cropped around around 1024 x 256 pixels will keep file size down with an acceptable resolution for most devices. 

``` yaml
image:
  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg
```

This makes the assumption that the feature image is in the *files* folder. To add a feature image to a post or page just include the filename in the front matter like so.
